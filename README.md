# Scrimba Projects

This repo was made with the intent to archive the projects I made in the [Scrimba website](https://scrimba.com/allcourses).

The website is structured in the following manner:

```
 Main Page:
    [Html] <<Index>>
    res:
        [CSS] <<Stylesheet>>
        <<Shared Images>>
    websites:
        [directory] <<Name of project>>:
            [Html] <<Main Page of the project>>
            [CSS] <<Stylesheet>>

```

You can look at a live demo at this [Netlify website](https://mirkoruhlscrimba.netlify.app/)
